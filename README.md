# SpinTracker

This is a news aggregation app focused on tracking narratives accross outlets with different biases/perspectives.

It is built in AngularJS and Bootstrap, using data stored in Firebase.  The build process also included Grunt for the Sass styling.

It utilizes a simple Node webscraper, using request and cheerio to save article information from RSS feeds to the Firebase database.

SpinTracker was my capstone project for the front-end portion on the Full Stack Web Development course at Nashville Software School.
